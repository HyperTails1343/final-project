The cars that people buy vary heavily on their needs and preferences. The following data was pulled from Kaggle datasets. It was then imported into RStudio to give viewers a look at the data. As you can see, the type of used vehicles bought from an auction is based on price, efficiency, and preference.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
read_csv("USA_cars_datasets.csv")
```
