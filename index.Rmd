The cars that people buy vary heavily on their needs and preferences. The following data was pulled from Kaggle datasets. It was then imported into RStudio to give viewers a look at the data. As you can see, the type of used vehicles bought from an auction is based on price, efficiency, and preference.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
```


```{r}
cars <- read_csv("USA_cars_datasets.csv")
cars |>  select(brand, price) |> 
  slice(1:35) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = brand, y = price))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)+
  theme_classic()
  labs(title = "Correlation of Car Brands and Prices", subtitle = "People buy different brands for different prices.", caption = "Kaggle (some year idk)")
  
```
